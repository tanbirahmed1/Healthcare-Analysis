Healthcare Analysis Project

Introduction:

Welcome to the Healthcare Dataset Analysis project! This project aims to provide valuable insights into healthcare data through data manipulation, analysis, and visualization techniques. The dataset used in this project is a synthetic healthcare dataset generated to mimic real-world healthcare records, allowing data enthusiasts to practice and develop their skills in data science and analytics within the healthcare domain.


Dataset Information:

The dataset consists of various attributes related to patients, admissions, medical conditions, treatments, and billing information. Each row represents a unique healthcare record, providing a rich source of information for exploration and analysis. Here's a brief overview of the columns in the dataset:

- Name
- Age
- Gender
- Blood Type
- Medical Condition
- Date of Admission
- Doctor
- Hospital
- Insurance Provider
- Billing Amount
- Room Number
- Admission Type
- Discharge Date
- Medication
- Test Results


Analysis Tasks:

The project includes a wide range of analysis tasks to explore and derive insights from the healthcare dataset. Some of the key analysis tasks include:

1. Demographic Analysis: Analyze the distribution of patients by gender, age demographics, and correlation between age and medical conditions.
   
2. Medical Condition Analysis: Identify the most common medical conditions, analyze billing amounts associated with different medical conditions, and explore patterns in prescribed medications.
   
3. Hospital and Admission Analysis: Investigate the distribution of admissions across hospitals, analyze admission types, and explore the relationship between hospital size and billing amounts.
   
4. Insurance Analysis: Examine the distribution of insurance providers among patients and analyze billing amounts based on insurance providers.
   
5. Treatment and Outcome Analysis: Explore medication usage patterns, analyze medical test results, and investigate patient outcomes.
   
6. Temporal Analysis: Analyze trends over time in admissions, medical conditions, and billing amounts.
